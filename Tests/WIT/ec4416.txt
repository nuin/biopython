NAME        S-Alkylcysteine lyase
CLASS       Lyases
            Carbon-sulfur lyases
SYSNAME     S-Alkyl-L-cysteine alkylthiol-lyase (deaminating)
REACTION    an S-Alkyl-L-cysteine + H2O = an Alkyl thiol + NH3 + Pyruvate
SUBSTRATE   S-Alkyl-L-cysteine
            H2O
PRODUCT     Alkyl thiol
            NH3
            Pyruvate
COFACTOR    Pyridoxal phosphate
COMMENT     A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. Decomposes S-alkyl-L-cysteines by
            alpha,beta-elimination. Possibly identical, in yeast, with
            EC 4.4.1.8.
