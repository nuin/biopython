* Protozoan/cyanobacterial globins signature *
**********************************************

Globins are heme-containing  proteins involved in  binding and/or transporting
oxygen [1]. Almost all globins belong to a large family (see <PDOC00793>), the
only exceptions  are  the  following proteins which form a family of their own
[2,3]:

 - Monomeric  hemoglobins  from the protozoan Paramecium caudatum, Tetrahymena
   pyriformis and Tetrahymena thermophila.
 - Cyanoglobin from the cyanobacteria Nostoc commune.
 - Globins  LI637  and  LI410  from  the chloroplast of the alga Chlamydomonas
   eugametos.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY48.23.

These proteins  contain a conserved histidine which could be involved in heme-
binding. As a signature pattern, we use a conserved region that ends with this
residue.

-Consensus pattern: F-[LF]-x(5)-G-[PA]-x(4)-G-[KRA]-x-[LIVM]-x(3)-H
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.
