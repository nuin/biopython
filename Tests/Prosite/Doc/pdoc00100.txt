******************************************
* Protein kinases signatures and profile *
******************************************

Eukaryotic  protein kinases [1 to 5]  are  enzymes  that   belong  to  a  very
extensive family of  proteins which share a conserved catalytic core common to
both serine/threonine and  tyrosine protein kinases.  There  are  a  number of
conserved regions in the catalytic domain of protein kinases. We have selected
two of these regions to build signature patterns.  The  first region, which is
located in the N-terminal extremity of the catalytic domain, is a glycine-rich
stretch of residues in the vicinity  of a lysine residue, which has been shown
to be involved in ATP binding.   The second  region,  which is  located in the
central part of the  catalytic  domain,  contains  a  conserved  aspartic acid
residue  which is important for the catalytic activity  of  the enzyme [6]; we
have derived  two signature patterns for that region: one specific for serine/
threonine kinases  and  the  other  for  tyrosine kinases. We also developed a
profile which is based on the alignment in [1] and covers the entire catalytic
domain.

-Consensus pattern: [LIV]-G-{P}-G-{P}-[FYWMGSTNH]-[SGA]-{PW}-[LIVCAT]-{PD}-x-
                    [GSTACLIVMFY]-x(5,18)-[LIVMFYWCSTAR]-[AIVP]-[LIVMFAGCKR]-K
                    [K binds ATP]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: the majority
 of known  protein  kinases  but it fails to find a number of them, especially
 viral kinases  which  are  quite  divergent in this region and are completely
 missed bythis pattern.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 35.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYC]-x-[HY]-x-D-[LIVMFY]-K-x(2)-N-[LIVMFYCT](3)
                    [D is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: Most serine/
 threonine  specific protein  kinases  with  10 exceptions (half of them viral
 kinases) and  also  Epstein-Barr  virus BGLF4 and Drosophila ninaC which have
 respectively Ser and Arg instead of the conserved Lys and which are therefore
 detected by the tyrosine kinase specific pattern described below.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 1.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFYC]-x-[HY]-x-D-[LIVMFY]-[RSTAC]-x(2)-N-[LIVMFYC](3)
                    [D is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL tyrosine
 specific protein  kinases  with  the  exception of human ERBB3 and mouse blk.
 This pattern    will    also    detect    most    bacterial    aminoglycoside
 phosphotransferases [8,9]  and  herpesviruses ganciclovir kinases [10]; which
 are proteins structurally and evolutionary related to protein kinases.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 15.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL,  except
 for three  viral  kinases.  This  profile  also  detects  receptor  guanylate
 cyclases (see   <PDOC00430>)  and  2-5A-dependent  ribonucleases.    Sequence
 similarities between  these  two  families  and the eukaryotic protein kinase
 family have been noticed before. It also detects Arabidopsis thaliana kinase-
 like protein TMKL1 which seems to have lost its catalytic activity.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 4.

-Note: if a protein  analyzed  includes the two protein kinase signatures, the
 probability of it being a protein kinase is close to 100%
-Note: eukaryotic-type protein  kinases  have  also  been found in prokaryotes
 such as Myxococcus xanthus [11] and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
-Note: the  patterns  shown  above has been updated since their publication in
 [7].
-Note: this  documentation  entry  is linked  to both signature patterns and a
 profile. As  the profile is much more sensitive than the patterns, you should
 use it if you have access to the necessary software tools to do so.
