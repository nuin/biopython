******************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is known as the cellulase family D [3] or as  the glycosyl hydrolases
family 8  [4,E1].  The  enzymes  which  are  currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Acetobacter xylinum endonuclease cmcAX.
 - Bacillus strain KSM-330 acidic endonuclease K (Endo-K).
 - Cellulomonas josui endoglucanase 2 (celB).
 - Cellulomonas uda endoglucanase.
 - Clostridium cellulolyticum endoglucanases C (celcCC).
 - Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases A (celA).
 - Erwinia chrysanthemi minor endoglucanase y (celY).
 - Bacillus circulans beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.73).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhjM.

The most conserved region in  these enzymes is  a stretch of about 20 residues
that contains  two conserved aspartate. The first asparatate is thought [5] to
act as the nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism. We have used this region as
a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: A-[ST]-D-[AG]-D-x(2)-[IM]-A-x-[SA]-[LIVM]-[LIVMG]-x-A-
                    x(3)-[FW]
                    [The first D is an active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.
