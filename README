Biopython README file
=====================

The Biopython Project (http://www.biopython.org/) is an international
association of developers of freely available Python tools for
computational molecular biology.

biopython.org provides an online resource for modules, scripts, and
web links for developers of Python-based software for life science
research.  Thanks to bioperl, we can also provide web, FTP and CVS
space for individuals and organizations wishing to distribute or
otherwise make available standalone scripts & code.

This Biopython package is made available under generous terms.  Please
see the LICENSE file for further details.



System Requirements
-------------------

o Python 1.52 or above

Some of the testing code will not work with DOS.


Installation
------------

Currently, this package is 100% pure Python so there is nothing to
compile.  All you need to do is add the directory where 'biopython' is
installed to the $PYTHONPATH environment variable.  All the libraries
should be available under the 'Bio' package.




Contributing, Bug Reports
-------------------------

Biopython is run by volunteers from all over the world, with many
types of backgrounds. We are always looking for people interested in
helping with code development, web-site management, technical
administration, and whatever else comes up.

If you wish to contribute, please visit the web site and join our
mailing list.

We currently have no system set up for handling bug reports.  For now,
please report bugs to biopython@biopython.org.



Distribution Structure
----------------------

Bio/          The python package that makes up biopython
Doc/          Documentation
Experimental/ Experimental code, not officially part of the distribution
LICENSE       License information for this package
NEWS          Release notes and news
README        This file
Scripts/      Miscellaneous, possibly useful, standalone scripts
Tests/        Regression testing code

The regression tests are currently all broken!  We need to develop a
workable framework for doing this right.



To Do
-----

(In no particular order...)

- Annotations on sequences
- BLAST additions
  o scripting front end to NCBIWWW
  o PSI-BLAST on WWW
- parsers
  o SWISSPROT
    - add parser for Protein class
    - WWW access
  o SCOP
    - needs to be done
  o Medline
    - WWW queries for PubMed
  o Enzyme
    - add parsers, iterator, dictionary, etc.
  o Prosite
    - WWW interface
  o Prodoc
    - WWW interface
  o PDB
    - needs to be done
    - build on Andrew's UPDB?
  o Genbank
    - needs to be done
- generalize parsers
- bug database
- improve regression testing framework
  o generate testing files
  o short tests and long tests
  o more descriptive error messages
  o count the tests
- documentation
- look into Zope-ifying the web site

If you see something here you would like to work on, please let me
know!

Thanks,
