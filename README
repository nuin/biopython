Biopython README file
=====================

The Biopython Project (http://www.biopython.org/) is an international
association of developers of freely available Python tools for
computational molecular biology.

biopython.org provides an online resource for modules, scripts, and
web links for developers of Python-based software for life science
research.  Thanks to bioperl, we can also provide web, FTP and CVS
space for individuals and organizations wishing to distribute or
otherwise make available standalone scripts & code.

This Biopython package is made available under generous terms.  Please
see the LICENSE file for further details.



System Requirements
-------------------

o Python 1.52 or above
o distutils



Installation
------------

XXX distutils

XXX out of date
Currently, this package is 100% pure Python so there is nothing to
compile.  All you need to do is add the directory where 'biopython' is
installed to the $PYTHONPATH environment variable.  All the libraries
should be available under the 'Bio' package.


XXX to test
python br_regrtest.py




Contributing, Bug Reports
-------------------------

Biopython is run by volunteers from all over the world, with many
types of backgrounds. We are always looking for people interested in
helping with code development, web-site management, technical
administration, and whatever else comes up.

If you wish to contribute, please visit the web site and join our
mailing list.

We currently have no system set up for handling bug reports.  For now,
please report bugs to biopython@biopython.org.
