News for the Biopython Project
==============================

This file contains release notes and general news
about the biopython project.



August 1999

- Call for Participation sent out to relevant mailing lists, news
groups.

The Biopython Project (http://www.biopython.org/) is a new open
collaborative effort to develop freely available Python libraries and
applications that address the needs of current and future work in
bioinformatics, including sequence analysis, structural biology,
pathways, expression data, etc.  When available, the source code will
be released as open source (http://www.biopython.org/License.shtml)
under terms similar to Python.

This is a Call for Participation for interested people to join the
project.  We are hoping to attract people from a diverse set of
backgrounds to help with code development, site maintenance,
scientific discussion, etc.  This project is open to everyone.  If
you're interested, please visit the web page, join the biopython
mailing list, and let us know what you think!
