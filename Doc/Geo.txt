GEO is a gene expression and hybridization array data repository.

The Geo (Gene Expression Omnibus) module works with Geo-formatted sequence data.
Data is available at:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/

The following code fragment is an example of how to parse Geo files into
a record and print the record.

    fh = open(os.path.join("Geo", file))
    records = Bio.Geo.Iterator( fh, Bio.Geo.RecordParser(debug_level=0))
    while 1:
        record = records.next()
        if record is not None:
            print record
            pass
        else:
            break
    print "\n"
