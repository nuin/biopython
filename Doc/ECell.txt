ECell
========


ECell
---------------

Ecell converts the ECell input from spreadsheet format to an intermediate format, described in
http://www.e-cell.org/manual/chapter2E.html#3.2.  It provides an alternative to the perl script
supplied with the Ecell2 distribution at http://bioinformatics.org/project/?group_id=49.

ECell expects a spreadsheet exported in delimited text format. The file should be read with
FilteredReader using the default filter chain to remove extraneous characters.
