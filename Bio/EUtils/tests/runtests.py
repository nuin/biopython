The EUtils package is not on your PYTHONPATH.

Here are a couple ways to test the EUtils distribution
before doing an install.

 1. make a symbolic link to the distribution directory
 
      ln -s ../EUtils .

    This is what I do for my testing.

 2. Use env to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable for
    this test

     env PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py

     or if you already have a PYTHONPATH

     env PYTHONPATH=..:$PYTHONPATH python runtests.py

If you are on a non-Unix-like system, consult the documentation for
setting the PYTHONPATH.

You should not need either of these options to test an installed
version of EUtils.
