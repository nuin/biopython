 = CVS 

Added to Biopython's CVS tree.
Fixed problem where setup was missing the DTDs.

Fixed regression tests so they aren't order dependent.

Removed unittest.py from the distribution since the patch to force
test ordering didn't work.

Set the SAX parser feature so it doesn't attempt to access the DTD
URL.

First release.
