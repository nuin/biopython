Type 'make' to build the KDTree module. You might need to 
correct the path to Python.h in the makefile.

During installation the already present swigged file KDTree.swig.c++ is
used. This should work without any problem. If you want to rebuild the
swig file for some reason just remove KDTree.swig.cpp and type 'make'. 

Structure of the module:

KDTree.cpp      C++ KDTree code
KDTree.h        C++ header for KDTree code 
KDTree.i        SWIG input file for KDTree.C
KDTree.swig.cpp SWIG generated wrapper for KDTree.C
_CKDTree.so     SWIG generated KDTree shared library
CKDTree.py      SWIG generated python code to access KDTree shared library
KDTree.py       Hand implemented python module for accessing CKDTree.py       
Makefile        Makefile for the shared module
README          This file


KDTree.py contains examples of how to use the module.
