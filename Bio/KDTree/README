During installation the already present swigged file KDTree.swig.c++ is
used, because I could not get Distutils to work correctly with swig.
This should work without any problem. If you want to rebuild the
swig file for some reason just type "make". 

Structure of the module:

KDTree.cpp      C++ KDTree code
KDTree.h        C++ header for KDTree code 
KDTree.i        SWIG input file for KDTree.C
KDTree.swig.cpp SWIG generated wrapper for KDTree.C
_CKDTree.so     SWIG generated KDTree shared library
CKDTree.py      SWIG generated python code to access KDTree shared library
KDTree.py       Hand implemented python module for public access to CKDTree.py       
Makefile        Generate KDTree.swig.C
README          This file

Cheers,
